This Streamlit app allows users to easily convert PDF files into editable Word documents (.docx). With a clean and simple interface, users can upload any PDF file and instantly download the converted text as a Word file. The app uses PyPDF2 to extract text from each page of the PDF and python-docx to generate the Word document. Built entirely with Python and Streamlit, it provides a lightweight and efficient solution for basic text-based PDF conversion. This tool is ideal for students, professionals, and anyone looking to extract text content from PDFs without installing heavy software. Note that it works best with PDFs containing selectable (non-scanned) text. For image-based PDFs, OCR functionality would need to be added separately. To run this app locally, ensure you have streamlit, PyPDF2, and python-docx installed, or deploy it easily on Streamlit Cloud by including a requirements.txt file with the necessary packages.
